            <h1>Technology Forecasts: Artificial Intelligence</h1>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence, or machine learning, as it’s referred to by some, is the use of algorithms to instruct computers or robots to perform processes characteristic of humans. Including the ability to discover meaning, learn from previous events, make
                generalizations and to apply creating new opportunities and evolving current positions, rather than eliminating them. “The creation of machine learning tools is allowing reason. The unique ability to solve problems and use reason to reach
                a predefined goal or solution is what makes artificial intelligence unique.
            </p>

            <p>
                We caught up with Sherri Marquand, a Data Scientist for KinetEco, Inc., who worked with a team of engineers to develop self-healing solar panel grids. “We are in a unique time in history, similar to the industrial revolution, where industry is changing,
                and new innovations are transforming the landscape for both work and pleasure”, she said. “Machine learning is changing the landscape, and just like in the early 20th century people will need to make career changes to keep up with the
                innovations. The exciting news is that we are already seeing new industries and job opportunities that will fill the gaps created by automation and artificial intelligence.”
            </p>

            <p>
                The disruption of industries, especially banking, insurance and retail will likely eliminate positions that are known for repetitive, redundant tasks. The good news it’s creating new opportunities and evolving current positions, rather than eliminating
                them. “The creation of machine learning tools is allowing new opportunities for employees and creating new career paths," said Doug Smith, direction of operations at Two Trees Olive Oil. “We excited to use automation for repetitive tasks
                and offer more engaging roles and opportunities to our employees.”
            </p>

            <h2>The Future of AI Technology</h2>
            <p>
                A surprising result of automation is the new ways artificial intelligence can inform opportunities to update outdated and inefficient processes. While we may have wild imaginations, that fear the Matrix may one day become a reality, the reality is that
                artificial intelligence is more likely to inform critical business processes and enhance research and development.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Machine learning is a business solution, a way to optimize results, not a replacement for human thought,” according to Smith. “We are not planning to reduce our workforce, we are planning to fine tune our processes and optimize work/life balance, a core
                principle of our employee culture.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence is also having an impact in medical research and may one day help to prevent and cure diseases. It is also paving ways to prevent accidental deaths, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
            </p>

                People living with disabilities are benefiting from AI technologies designed to transform the world around them. Apps can tell a blind person about their surroundings, so they can make informed decisions. Smart technology that allows you to change a thermostat
                or turn on lights are helping disabled people live more independently.
