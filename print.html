        <h1>Exercises you really can do at your desk</h1>
        <p>We&#8217;ve all seen the long lists of extensive exercises you can do to increase your activity at your desk. If you&#8217;re one of the many who spends long hours at your desk, incorporating activities is a great idea. However, some of the activities
            making their way into fitness blogs don&#8217;t seem possible, unless you have a private office or work from home. While I agree that yoga is great for your health, doing the downward dog might raise the eyebrows of your coworkers, especially
            if you&#8217;re in a cubicle.</p>
        <p>We&#8217;ve come up with five simple activities that you can do every day, and will give you the extra impact you&#8217;re looking for, without making you feel foolish in front of others.</p>
        <h2>Leg Lifts </h2>
        <p>Sitting for long periods can decrease circulation and cause water retention. This simple exercise will help increase your circulation and strengthen your leg muscles.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>While sitting straight up at your desk, raise one leg and hold it in place for 10-15 seconds.</li>
            <li>Repeat with other leg.</li>
            <li>Aim for 10-15 reps with each leg.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Shoulder Rolls</h2>
        <p>Working at a desk can cause neck, shoulder, and arm stiffness. This exercise will help loosen up stiff shoulders and arms.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sit straight up in your chair.</li>
            <li>Relax your shoulders, keeping them straight down.</li>
            <li>Start rotating your shoulders in a circular motion, going as far back, up, forward, and down as you can.</li>
            <li>Do for 10 repetitions, then reverse direction, going forward, up, back, and down.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Toe Raises</h2>
        <p>While most of these exercises can be done sitting down, this one requires standing. Just like the leg lifts, it helps increase your circulation. However, since youâ€™re using more of your body weight, it&#8217;s more beneficial for strengthening
            your leg muscles.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>While standing at your desk, raise your feet so you&#8217;re standing on your tippy toes.</li>
            <li>Hold for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Repeat 20 times.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Core Rotations </h2>
        <p>Core strengthening helps you improve your stability and balance. It also helps prevent back pain, improves respiratory function and weight distribution, and helps prevent muscle injury &#8211; in addition to providing a host of other health benefits.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Raise your arms straight out, and close your fists.</li>
            <li>Bring your hands together until your knuckles are touching each other.</li>
            <li>Rotate your torso from side to side, keeping your arms locked in place.</li>
            <li>Make sure your arms remain still &#8211; you want to rotate at your torso.</li>
            <li>Repeat 10-15 times on each side.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Chair rolls </h2>
        <p>There are few exercises you can do at your desk that will offer you muscle strengthening (short of pulling out hand weights or doing full on push-ups). This exercise uses your chair and your body weight to create resistance and increase your body
            strength.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Holding the edge of the desk, push your chair in as close as you comfortably can.</li>
            <li>Lift your legs straight out.</li>
            <li>Push your chair away from your desk, with your legs still raised.</li>
            <li>Use your feet to pull your chair back in.</li>
            <li>Repeat 10-15 times.</li>
        </ul>
